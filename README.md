We implemented a Snake game with a twist using sdl in c++.
the game works by clicking the start button.
Instead of an obstacle you will encounter an enemy snake which you have to avoid
inorder to increase your highscore. Eat the apples, to make your snake grow,
and avoid hitting the boundaires, your player snake body and the enemy snake.
